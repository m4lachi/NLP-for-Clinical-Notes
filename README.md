# NLP for Clinical Notes

## Overview
This project focuses on building a Natural Language Processing (NLP) tool to process unstructured medical transcriptions. The tool extracts important details like treatment dates, side effects, and comorbidities, and maps them to standardized healthcare ontologies (e.g., SNOMED, ICD codes). This helps streamline clinical data analysis and supports healthcare research.

## Features
- **Text Preprocessing**: Cleans and tokenizes text, removing stop words and punctuation.
- **Named Entity Recognition (NER)**: Identifies medical entities such as treatments, side effects, and dates.
- **Ontology Mapping**: Maps extracted terms to healthcare standards like SNOMED and ICD codes.
- **Performance Evaluation**: Assesses the tool's accuracy using precision, recall, and F1-score.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**
- **NLP Libraries**: spaCy, NLTK
- **Datasets**: Synthetic or publicly available clinical text datasets
- **Healthcare Standards**: SNOMED, ICD codes

## Getting Started
### Prerequisites
- Install Python (>=3.7)  
- Install required libraries:
  ```bash
  pip install pandas spacy nltk
